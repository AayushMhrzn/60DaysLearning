# Day 01 â€“ Functions and Classes

## Topics Covered

- Function definition and calling
- Class and objects
- Constructors (`__init__` method)
- Instance methods
- Class methods

## Explanation

### Functions
A function is a reusable block of code.


### Class

Classes and Objects
A class is a blueprint to create objects (instances). The constructor (__init__) initializes the object attributes.

Class Methods
Class methods are bound to the class, not the instance. They can modify class state that applies across all instances.

# BankAccount Class Example

- **Constructor** to initialize the account holder's name and starting balance.
- **deposit(amount)** method to add money to the balance.
