# Day 5 - Image Grid with Vanilla NumPy & Understanding Color Spaces

## Image Grid with Vanilla NumPy
On Day 5, we explored how to create a square grid of images using only NumPy, without relying on any specialized image processing libraries. This involved:

- Understanding how images are represented as NumPy arrays.
- Calculating the grid size dynamically based on the number of images to form an approximately square layout.
- Using NumPy slicing to place each image in the correct position within a larger grid array.
- This exercise deepened understanding of array manipulation and indexing in NumPy.


## Understanding Color Spaces and Histograms
We also covered the basics of color spaces and their histograms:

- Different color spaces like RGB, BGR, HSV, LAB, and CMYK represent images differently based on how colors are encoded and perceived.
- RGB and BGR are common linear color spaces used in image processing; HSV separates hue, saturation, and value making it useful for color-based segmentation.
- LAB is a perceptually uniform color space that models human vision more closely.
- Histograms show the distribution of intensity values for each channel in a color space, useful for analyzing image content and performing tasks like contrast adjustment and segmentation.

Overall, Day 5 combined practical NumPy array skills with fundamental image processing concepts, preparing for more advanced computer vision tasks.
