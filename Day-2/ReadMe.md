# Day 2 Summary: Inheritance, Dunder Methods, Overloading & Functional Programming

## Inheritance
- Enables a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another (parent).
- Use `super()` to access parent class methods and constructors.

## Dunder (Magic) Methods
- Special methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__call__`, `__add__` customize object behavior.
- Examples: initialization, printing, calling objects like functions, operator overloading.

## Function & Operator Overloading
- Python does not support traditional function overloading; use default args.
- Operator overloading allows customizing operators (`+`, `*`, etc.) by defining dunder methods.

## Docstrings
- Use triple quotes `""" """` to document modules, classes, and functions.
- Accessible via `.__doc__`.

## Lambda Functions
- Anonymous, single-expression functions for short, inline use.

## Map and Reduce
- `map()` applies a function to all items in an iterable.
- `reduce()` applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs (needs `functools`).

## Decorators and Wrappers
- Functions that modify other functions without changing their code.
- Use `@decorator` syntax for easy application.
